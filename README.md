# Introduction
I'm a self-taught programmer who creates **websites**, **games**, and **apps**. My favorite tech stack for websites is **Next.js**, **Supabase**, and **shadcn UI**, which helps me make my sites look clean, consistent, and professional. I also work with **AI SDKs** and **Appwrite** for specific use cases.

I enjoy creating games for fun, especially 2D games, using the **Godot engine** and **GDScript** for scripting. For desktop apps, I use **Tauri**, which lets me leverage my web development knowledge to build lightweight applications. I used to make apps with Electron, but it was too heavy, so I switched immediately. For mobile apps, I use **React Native** because it just makes sense.

It's been **2 years** since I started coding. I began with HTML on my phone, never imagining I would come this far so quickly. I'm still in school, counting down the days until I can fully dive into the projects I want to build. In school I am in 12th grade, standing right at the edge of this so called school life, can’t wait to finally break free and do everything I couldn’t because of it
